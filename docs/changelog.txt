  a) Text 60 characters displayed in 1 line
  b) Text 120 characters displayed in 2 lines
  c) Text 240 characters displayed in 4 lines
  d) Integer numbers
  e) Decimal numbers
  f) Date
- Blank line or horizontal rules available to design the custom area
- Fexible order of custom fields, can be manipulated at any time
- The input/output format for decimal numbers and date can be
  set in the Administration
- For better fit in the layout the width of a custom textarea field can be
  set in the Administration
- Two absolut free configurable sort orders are available: Choose any field
  you like in the Admnisration (including custom fields)
- Free column order in the list view. Column order depends on the selected
  sort order.
- Support for images/logos (for Admins only). Admins will see a selection 
  box of all files in the img-directory of AddressBook and can assign it 
  to a record. The picture is shown in the upper right of the detail page.
- Image support can be enabled/disabled in the Administration
- Main Menu can now be disabled for all or guests only
- Second Main Menu line can be disabled, so that only categories, sort 
  orders and the search field are visible
- MySQL 3.x uses the Latin-1 character set as default. Most users have no
  permission to change these settings. Therefore names and companies are 
  now stored in special sort columns for correct sortings when special
  characters (Umlauts) are used. There is an admin setting where you can
  set up the character replacement to correct the sort for each language
- New column Prefix/Title (Mr. Mrs. etc.). Values can be set in the 
  Administration and are presented with a selection field in the form. This 
  column is visible only in the insert/edit form. You can disable it 
  completely in the Administration. It was added for compatibility with 
  future import/export extensions, particularly to export for serial 
  letters
- Admin setting for the sort order and displayof names in the list view, so 
  you can change the default «Last Name, First Name» to 
  «First Name Last Name», which is default in some countries
- Permission theme was changed in the way, that you can assign a kind of 
  sub-admins, if you give a a user the EDIT access for AddressBook in the 
  PostNuke permission system

BugFixes
--------
- Value for custom field 1 was shown twice indetail view
- Plus sign (+) was shown in list view, but was lost in the edit form
- Colums in the contact tab of the insert/edit form had a poor layout
  in small themes (800*600)
- Automatically detected URLs had no target ('_blank')
- Deletion of a contact label could lead to a dissorder of all following
  labels
- If the Admin edited a user's record, then the user had no longer access 
  to edit / delete this record, because now it was assigned to the Admin.
- The sort order in A-Z view was always assigned to the Last Name column
  and not the first column of the selected sort order
- The tabs in the insert/edit form didn't work with Opera and IE < 5.5
